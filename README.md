# Motivators :rocket: :heart:
* A mission makes me tick. I’m good at problem-solving and building great software, but above all I need to have something I’m striving for.
* I love empowering great engineers to build products they are proud of.
* Learning is a key part of my motivation at work, I'm drawn to things I've never done before.
* I have spent most of my career at mid-stage startups.  At one point I worked for eBay, and that was a wonderful exception. The awkward teenage years are a great time to make a difference at many organizations.

# Tech Stack :cloud: :whale:
* **Languages**: I'm a polyglot and generally open-minded about languages.  I am strongest in JavaScript, PHP and SQL, most interested in Python.
* **Operating Systems**: Laptop is MacOS, Infra is usually Linux (Ubuntu, Alpine)
* **AWS**: EC2, ECS, ECR, S3, RDS/Aurora, Lambda, Cloudformation, Route 53, API Gateway, CloudFront, Cloudwatch, CodeBuild, CodePipeline.
* **Other**: Docker, Docker Compose, Apache, Nginx, DNS, HTTP, SMTP

# How Hands-on Are You? :firefighter: :handshake:
A variation of this question is common in engineering leadership interviews.  It is important to define what we mean by hands-on. For some it is a synonym for writing code, but for me this is a broader set of activities as part of building great software.  These are some examples of hands-on acticities I have done over the last few years, with writing code representing a very small portion of my time.

* Code Review
* Troubleshooting
* Incident Response
* Read & Contribute to:
  * Product Requirements
  * Technical Design Documents / RFCs
  * Database Architecture
* Beta Testing UI or API features
* Write Code
* Deploying to Production

I wrote this README while assessing what is important to me in my career.  It helped, a lot.  I was inspired by my [friend Eric's](https://github.com/edj-boston) which is no longer online.
