# Motivators :rocket: :heart:
* A mission makes me tick. I’m good at problem-solving and building great software, but above all I need to have something I’m striving for.
* I love empowering great engineers to build products they are proud of.
* Learning is a key part of my motivation at work, I'm drawn to things I've never done before.
* I have spent most of my career at startups, mostly in the fast growth phase.  At one point I worked for eBay, and that was a wonderful exception. The awkward teenage years are a great time to make a difference, too.

# How Hands-on Are You? :firefighter: :handshake:
A variation of this question is common in engineering leadership interviews.  It is important to define what we mean by hands-on. For some it is a synonym for writing code, but for me this is a broader set of activities as part of building great software.  I love being hands-on, and relish the opportunity to contribute technically on a daily basis. These are some of the hands-on activities I enjoy:

* Code Review
* Troubleshooting
* Incident Response
* Read & Contribute to:
  * Product Requirements
  * Technical Design Documents / RFCs
  * Database Architecture
* Beta Testing UI or API features
* Write Code
* Deploying to Production
