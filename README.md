# More About Me
* A mission makes me tick. I’m good at problem-solving and building great software, but above all I love to have something I’m striving for.
* I love empowering great engineers to build products they are proud of.
* I'm a polyglot and generally open-minded about languages.  I am strongest in JavaScript and PHP.
* Learning is a key part of the way I approach life.  I'm drawn to things I've never done before.
* I have spent most of my career at mid-stage startups.  At one point I worked for eBay, and that was a wonderful exception. The awkward teenage years are a great time to make a difference at many organizations.
* I wrote this while assessing what is important to me in my career.  It helped, a lot.  I was inspired by my [friend Eric's readme](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/readmes/eric-johnson/)
